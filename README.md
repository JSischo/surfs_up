## Purpose of the Analysis
> The purpose of this project was to perform further queries on a weather database for June and December temperatures on Oahu. The analysis of the results will help to determine the historical temperatures from low to high and then average. This will help our customer in their decision making process on whether or not to open a surf and ice cream shop.

## Results:

Following are the most pertinent findings from the statistical analysis of the queries that were conducted (see figures for details):
- The high temperature between June and Decemeber does not vary significantly (**83 in Dec and 85 in June**). Excellent surfing and ice cream temperatures!
- June is slightly higher on average than December (**75 vs. 71 respectively**).
- December low temperatures are a bit cooler than June (**56 vs. 64 respectively**).

## Summary:

Overall, it looks like the surf and ice cream business could be run successfully year-round. The average and high temperatures do not vary significantly between June and December on Oahu. We can assume that the low temperatures would occur overnight, most likely during non-business hours. I think given the June/December data, temperatures don't vary too much between seasons on Oahu. Following are some reccomended queries that could be conducted to help enhance the data for a more infomed decision to be made before opening a surf and ice cream shop. 
  > 1. Query temperatures for other months throughout the year to help determine if there may be temperature fluctuations during other times of the year. 
  > 2. Query termpartures grouped by specific data collection stations to help determine if temperatures are more favorable at a certain location on the island for business placement. 
  > 3. We previously ran queries on the database for rainfall during the past year on Oahu, but we might consider extending that query to include all know dates in the database to get a better hisorical picture of rainfall by month and possibly also by specific station. This will also help our client to determine if it makes sense to open their business and if so, where to place it as this business would rely heavily on good weather.
